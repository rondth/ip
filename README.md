### Understanding your task list

Henry supports three types of tasks:

| Symbol | Task type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[T]` | Todo | A task without a date or time |
| `[D]` | Deadline | A task that must be completed by a certain date or time |
| `[E]` | Event | A task that takes place between a start and end time |

The completion symbol shows whether a task is finished:

- `[ ]` means the task is not completed.
- `[X]` means the task is completed.

## Features

### Adding a todo: `todo`

Adds a task without a date or time.

**Format:** `todo DESCRIPTION`

**Example:**

```text
todo borrow a book
```

Henry adds the following task:

```text
[T][ ] borrow a book
```

Short form: `t borrow a book`

### Adding a deadline: `deadline`

Adds a task that must be completed by a particular date or time.

**Format:** `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE`

Henry accepts these date formats:

- `d/M/yyyy HHmm`, such as `2/12/2019 1800`
- `yyyy-MM-dd`, such as `2019-12-02`

A deadline without a time is set to the start of that day.

**Example:**

```text
deadline submit report /by 2/12/2019 1800
```

Henry displays:

```text
[D][ ] submit report (by: Dec 2 2019 6:00 PM)
```

Short form: `d submit report /by 2/12/2019 1800`

### Adding an event: `event`

```text
event project meeting /from Monday 2pm /to 4pm
```

Henry displays:

```text
[E][ ] project meeting (from: Monday 2pm to: 4pm)
```

Short form: `e project meeting /from Monday 2pm /to 4pm`

### Viewing all tasks: `list`

Shows every task and its current task number.

**Format:** `list`

**Example:**

```text
list
```

Henry displays:

```text
1. [T][ ] borrow a book
2. [D][X] submit report (by: Dec 2 2019 6:00 PM)

### Finding tasks: `find`

Finds tasks whose descriptions contain the given keyword.

**Format:** `find KEYWORD`

**Example:**

```text
find book
```

Short form: `f book`

> [!NOTE]
> Searching is case-sensitive. Search results are numbered for display, so use `list` to check a
> task's current number before marking, unmarking, or deleting it.

### Marking a task as completed: `mark`

Marks a task as completed using its number from `list`.

**Format:** `mark TASK_NUMBER`

**Example:**

```text
mark 2
```

Short form: `m 2`

### Marking a task as not completed: `unmark`

Returns a completed task to the not-completed state.

**Format:** `unmark TASK_NUMBER`

unmark 2
```

Short form: `u 2`

### Deleting a task: `delete`

Permanently removes a task using its number from `list`.

**Format:** `delete TASK_NUMBER`

**Example:**

```text
delete 1
```

The remaining tasks are renumbered automatically.

Short form: `del 1`

### Saying goodbye: `bye`

Displays Henry's farewell message.

**Format:** `bye`

Short form: `b`

When using the desktop interface, close the application window after you are finished.

### Saving data

Henry automatically saves your task list after you add, mark, unmark, or delete a task.

Saved tasks are loaded again the next time Henry starts. By default, they are stored in:

```text
data/henry.txt
```

No manual save command is required.
