# Console UI Test Plan

This file is the source of truth for `$test-ui`. Run each case in a fresh program process and stop the full test session at the first failure.
Unless a case provides initial data-file contents, ensure `data/henry.txt` does not exist before starting its process.
When a case specifies that `data/henry.txt` is a directory, create an empty directory at that path
instead of a file.

## Test case template

### UI-N: Short descriptive name

**Aim:** Describe the behavior this case verifies.

| Step | Input |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `command` |
| 2 | `bye` |

#### Expected startup output

```text
Paste the exact output printed before the first input here.
```

#### Expected output after step 1

```text
Paste the exact output caused by step 1 here.
```

#### Expected output after step 2

```text
Paste the exact output caused by step 2 here.
```

Use `<empty input>` when the user presses Enter without typing any characters. Use `<no output>` as the entire expected block when a step should produce no output. Preserve all other whitespace exactly.

### UI-1: Add and list all task types

**Aim:** Verify that todos, deadlines, and events are stored and displayed using their type-specific formats.

| Step | Input |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `todo borrow book` |
| 2 | `deadline do homework /by 2/12/2019 1800` |
| 3 | `event project meeting /from Mon 2pm /to 4pm` |
| 4 | `list` |
| 5 | `bye` |

X | 0 | unknown task
D | 2 | invalid status | Friday
E | 0 | missing end time | 2pm

#### Expected startup output

```text
____________________________________________________________
